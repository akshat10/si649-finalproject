      <h1>What is the secret formula of a successful <span style="color:red;"><strong>TED</strong></span> Talk? </h1>
      <p>
        I have a brilliant idea of Ted talk but I have never given one! Will people like it? I have a demo of my Ted talk but I got turned down by Tedx! What happened? I’m going to give a TEDx talk soon. When is the best time to give the talk? With all these questions, you may want to know: Hey, is there a secret formula to make a popular Ted talk? Now, here we found out something really interesting from the Ted talks starting from 1971 to 2017. 
        <br> <br>
        A number of views is one of the proxies to evaluate if the talk is popular or not. Before we exploring our findings, let’s watch the most popular Ted talk: Do schools kill creativity? </p>

        <h2>Monday Fun Day?</h2>
        
        <p>It is true that duration is one of the important elements of making the talk that may be well accepted by viewers. But do you know even when to give a talk also related to how popular it can be? Here is our finding about the number of views and the when the Ted talk has been given.</p>        



        <div class='tableauPlaceholder' style='width: 960px; height: 478px;'><object class='tableauViz' width='960' height='500' style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fus-east-1.online.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='&#47;t&#47;tedviz' /><param name='name' value='1202&#47;FilmHeat' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='showAppBanner' value='false' /><param name='filter' value='iframeSizedToWindow=true' /></object></div>


        <p>
          Interesting! Mondays are meant to be productive. It appears that Monday is the best day in a week to give a Ted Talk. As you can see from the visualization below, ted talks that take place on Mondays got the most views. So next time, when you are planning your Ted Talk, try giving your talk on Monday!

          <h2>Time is important: No one likes it too short but maybe sometimes!</h2>
          
          <p>What do you think about the most popular talk? Did it inspire you for your own talk? 
            Now let’s think about the talks you have watched. Do you feel like some of them are too long-winded? Do you think some of them are too short that you haven’t got enough information or entertainment before the end?  Do you think how long your talk is could also affect if your talk is going to be popular or not? 
            
            Here is our finding between the number of views and the duration of the talks.
            </p>        
  
  
          <div class='tableauPlaceholder' style='width: 960px; height: 478px;'><object class='tableauViz' width='960' height='500'style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fus-east-1.online.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='&#47;t&#47;tedviz' /><param name='name' value='1202&#47;Duration' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='showAppBanner' value='false' /><param name='filter' value='iframeSizedToWindow=true' /></object></div>

          <p>
            Most talks are about 2 minutes to 25 minutes. However, some really long-winded talks didn’t receive good feedbacks. Now let select these talks between 2 to 25 minutes to see what happens!
Instruction: Drag a rectangle of the talks --> Hover on the selections --> Choose ‘Keep only’.
<br>
<br>
It seems most talks can’t getting more number of views after reaching about 7 millions and most of them are published in earlier years.  But for the really popular ones (number of views is higher than 20 million) - including the most popular Ted talk until now - are ranging from 8 to 22 minutes. So when you are going to prepare a Ted talk, consider making it falls into this time duration to get a better chance to win the heart of more people!

        <h2>Final Interactive Prototype</h2>


        <p>
          By now, you should have gained some insights about the features of popular talks about time. However, the topic should be the key factor of a great talk! TED talks cover a wide range of topics, thus it can be a good chance to learn from other people who have given the talk with a similar topic as yours.
<br> <br>
Below you can select a specific topic relevant to your areas of expertise to get the top 5 talks falling under the topic. You can see the essential information (e.g. title, speaker, views, link) of the most-viewed talks, and get a sense of how did audience say about each talk? Is it ‘Inspiring’? Or ‘Beautiful”? Or maybe it makes them feel confused?
